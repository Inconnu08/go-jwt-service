My name is Mohammed Taufiqur Rahman
You can call me Taufiq (Tow-Fik)
I derive immense pleasure in learning things from the bottom,
and since I believe that everything lies in the details,
I make a constant effort to assimilate new concepts through and through.
Thank you for this wonderful learning experience.

What new knowledge or skills did you take away from this project?
    If you learned a new language for this assignment, make sure to tell us.
    I learned to use Wrangler CLI, Workers, KV, and Pages to build simple websites fast and effectively.
    For the Workers serverless API, I learned TypeScript and wrote the API in TypeScript.
    From the systems assessment, I learned how to store JWT tokens in cookies for better security.
    I also enjoyed using Cloudflare tunnel and the fact that it is free to experiment with.

What was the most difficult part of this assignment?
    The most challenging part for me was how to declare globals in Typescript and access my KV store bindings
    as I had no experience in such concepts. Choosing a name for my website was hard too.
